This repository contains the full code, dataset, visuals, and write-up for my machine learning project: *Predicting Student Performance with Decision Trees*.  

The project investigates how a Decision Tree classifier can predict whether students pass or fail based on academic, social, and background factors. It was inspired by the Symbolist philosophy in Pedro Domingos’ *The Master Algorithm*, focusing on interpretable, rule-based learning.
